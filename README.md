# ionic4-ngxs-firebase

- **Just Started the migration of the applicaton, please post issues if there are questions and watch the repo for updates**

Sample ionic4 app using ngxs instead of ngrx... it saves a **TREMENDOUS** amount of boilerblate code, it also allows you to remove the observables craziness from the code
