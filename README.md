- **Just Started the migration of the applicaton, please post issues if there are questions and watch the repo for updates**

Sample ionic4 app using ngxs instead of ngrx... it saves a **TREMENDOUS** amount of boilerblate code, it also allows you to remove the observables craziness from the code

### Getting Started

You must set your own firebase credentials in the application to run this demo. See `src/app/store/firestore-services.ts`.

```javascript
firebase.initializeApp({
    // YOUR VALUES HERE
});
```
